  summary: >-
    I successfully defended my PhD thesis on algorithmic, fully-automated verification of concurrent programs.

    <p>Algorithmic verification can prove the absence of, or identify, concurrency bugs that are easily missed by programmers and unlikely to be found by testing.
    Yet, verification algorithms often struggle to find correctness proofs that cover all the many possible schedulings (*interleavings*) of a concurrent program.
    We investigate how*commutativity reasoning* can be tightly integrated into verification algorithms, increasing the space of programs that can be successfully verified,
    and improving the verification performance.
    The notion of commutativity (of statements from different threads) allows the verification to group interleavings into equivalence classes,
    and to verify only a subset of interleavings containing at least one representative per equivalence class (a *reduction*).
    We show that, given a program, there is a large space of possible reductions that a verification algorithm could verify.
    Each reduction can be described by fixing
    (i) a particular notion of commutativity (and consequently, the resulting equivalence)
    and (ii) a mechanism that decides which representatives to choose from each equivalence class.
    We present a verification approach that is parametric in both a notion of commutativity (or, in fact, multiple notions)
    and a choice mechanism for representatives.
    We investigate how the choice of these two parameters affects the verification power and the efficiency of the verification.
    In addition to the theoretical analysis, we implement our verification approach in a state-of-the-art algorithmic verifier and evaluate its practical potential.

  summary: >-
    The benefits of commutativity-based reduction in the verification of concurrent programs are well-established:
    By focusing on a representative subset of program interleavings, soundly selected based on a given commutativity relation between statements,
    the verification can succeed with simpler invariants and can avoid combinatorial explosion.
    Yet, there are many possible commutativity relations.
    In this talk, we focus on the setting of fully-automated algorithmic verification, and explore strategies to derive commutativity relations that are sound by construction.
    As the resulting commutativity relations are in general incomparable,
    we further discuss the potential of combining multiple commutativity relations,
    and the challenges for algorithmic realizations of such combinations.

  summary: >-
    To verify concurrent programs with unbounded loops, algorithmic verifiers must infer inductive invariants
    that show correctness for all infinitely many possible executions of the program.
    Due to the many possible interleavings of the program's threads, such invariants are often complex (requiring non-linear arithmetic, quantifiers, or reasoning with ghost variables)
    and out-of-reach for most invariant inference algorithms.
    In this talk, I present a series of works investigating how the notion of commutativity simplifies proofs of concurrent programs and thereby empowers algorithic verification.
    The idea of commutativity is based on the observation that some program statements can be reordered without affecting the outcome of an execution,
    and hence it suffices to verify a suitably-chosen subset of interleavings (rather than all interleavings) to conclude correctness of an entire concurrent program.
    We will see how commutativity-based combinatorial algorithms interact with symbolic reasoning over variables with infinite domains,
    and how commutativity can both extend the theoretical expressiveness and contribute to the practical success of verification approaches.

  summary: >-
    Verification of concurrent programs is a hard problem.
    Beyond the state space explosion known from model checking, a new challenge arises for invariant-based verification of concurrent programs over infinite data domains:
    the inductive invariants needed to prove correctness of all possible program interleavings are often complex and out of reach for automated invariant inference algorithms.
    In this talk, I will present several recent works investigating how *commutativity* simplifies such proofs of concurrent programs.
    The notion of commutativity is based on the observation that some statements can be reordered without affecting the outcome of an execution
    and it suffices to verify a suitably chosen subset of interleavings to conclude the correctness of an entire concurrent program.
    I will discuss how commutativity reasoning can extend the theoretical expressiveness of verification approaches,
    in which cases commutativity makes the difference between finding a proof and never terminating,
    and how symbolic reasoning (over variables with infinite domain) interacts with commutativity.
