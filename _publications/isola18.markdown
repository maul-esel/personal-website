abstract: >-
  By restructuring and reconfiguring itself at run-time, a collective adaptive system (CAS)
  is able to fulfill its requirements under uncertain, ever-changing environmental conditions.
  Indeed, this process of self-organization (SO) is of utmost importance for the ability of the CAS to perform.
  However, it is hard to design high-performing SO mechanisms, because the environmental conditions are partially unpredictable at design time.
  Thus, a crucial aid for the development of SO mechanisms is a tool set enabling performance evaluations at design time
  in order to select the best-fitting mechanism and parametrize it.
  We present a metric for measuring the performance of an SO mechanism as well as a framework that enables evaluation of this metric.
  The proposed metric is evaluated for different kinds of SO mechanisms in two case studies: a smart energy management system and a self-organizing production cell.
