abstract: >-
  Although there has been significant interest in extending the AGM paradigm of belief change beyond finitary logics,
  the computational aspects of AGM have remained almost untouched. We investigate the computability of AGM contraction on non-finitary logics,
  and show an intriguing negative result: there are infinitely many uncomputable AGM contraction functions in such logics.
  Drastically, even if we restrict the theories used to represent epistemic states, in all non-trivial cases, the uncomputability remains.
  On the positive side, we use BÃ¼chi automata to construct computable AGM contraction functions on Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).
