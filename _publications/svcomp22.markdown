abstract: >-
  Ultimate GemCutter verifies concurrent programs using the CEGAR paradigm, by generalizing from spurious counterexample traces to larger sets of correct traces.
  We integrate classical CEGAR generalization with orthogonal generalization across interleavings.
  Thereby, we are able to prove correctness of programs otherwise out-of-reach for interpolation-based verification.
  The competition results show significant advantages over other concurrency approaches in the Ultimate family.
