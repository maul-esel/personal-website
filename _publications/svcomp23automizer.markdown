abstract: >-
  The verification approach of Ultimate Automizer utilizes SMT formulas.
  This paper presents techniques to keep the size of the formulas small.
  We focus especially on a normal form, called CommuHash normal form that was easy to implement and had a significant impact on the runtime of our tool.
