abstract: >-
  The verification of Ultimate Automizer works on an SMT-LIB-based model of a C program.
  If we choose an SMT-LIB theory of (mathematical) integers, the translation is not precise, because we overapproximate bitwise operations.
  In this paper we present a translation for bitwise operations that improves the precision of this overapproximation.
