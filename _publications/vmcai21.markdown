abstract: >-
  Given a verification problem for a concurrent program (with a fixed number of threads) over infinite data domains,
  we can construct a model checking problem for an abstraction of the concurrent program through a Petri net
  (a problem which can be solved using McMillanâ€™s unfoldings technique).
  We present a method of abstraction refinement which translates Floyd/Hoare-style proofs for sample traces into additional synchronization constraints for the Petri net.
