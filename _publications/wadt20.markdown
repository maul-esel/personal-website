abstract: >-
  Deductive program verification is a powerful tool to gain confidence in the correctness of software.
  However, its application to real programs faces a major hurdle:
  Each programming language requires development of dedicated verification tool support.
  In this work, we aim to advance deductive software verification to arbitrary programming languages.
  We developed a tool that derives algebraic specifications for the deductive proof assistant KIV
  from the syntax and operational semantics of a programming language specified in the ùïÇ semantic framework.
  We adapt and implement the generic One-Path Reachability calculus and provide instant tool support for deductive proofs.
  Through a sophisticated automation approach, we drastically reduce the manual proof steps.
