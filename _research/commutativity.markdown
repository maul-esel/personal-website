My main research focus is on algorithmic verification of concurrent programs.
I investigate how <span class="highlight">partial order reduction</span>
and the underlying notion of <span class="highlight">commutativity</span>
enable verification algorithms to find simpler correctness proofs for concurrent programs,
thereby allowing for the verification of more programs,
and increasing verification efficiency.
